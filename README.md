-Background
Depending on what text you are reading the origin of tai chi chuan may vary, it's creation
is typically attributed to Chang San-Feng, a daoist, during the Sung dynasty.

Daoist philosophy played a large rule in chinese culture and in the development of
internal martial arts.

The major internal martial arts, of which there are three xing yi quan, ba gua quan
and tai chi quan, utilize aspects of daoist philosophy and the name tai chi chuan is
derived from daoist philosophy.

The name tai chi chuan is usually translated as supreme ultimate fist but because chuan translates to fist and the origin of the term tai chi
it could also be translated as yin-yang fist.

From this point on I am going to refer to tai chi chuan as tai chi.
-----------

The first branch of tai chi that was well know outside of the daoism was Chen style, most other branches
of tai chi like Yang Stye, Wu Style, Hao Style & Li Style are directly or in-directly derived from
chen style.
